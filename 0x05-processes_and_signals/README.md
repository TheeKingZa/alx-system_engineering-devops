* What is a PID?
--------------------------------------------------------------

    A PID (Process Identifier) is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each running process on a computer system. It is used by the operating system to keep track of and manage processes. PIDs are essential for various system tasks, including process management, monitoring, and termination.

--------------------------------------------------------------
* What is a Process?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A process is a running instance of a program or application on a computer. It represents the execution of a specific task or program in memory. Each process has its own memory space, system resources, and state, making it independent of other processes running on the system.

--------------------------------------------------------------
* How to Find a Process' PID?
--------------------------------------------------------------
You can find a process's PID using various commands, depending on your operating system:

Linux/Unix:
To find a process's PID in Linux/Unix, you can use the ps command. For example:

Bash
==Code==

ps aux | grep <process_name>

--
Replace <process_name> with the name of the process you want to find. The PID will be listed in the output.

Windows:
In Windows, you can use the tasklist command to list all running processes along with their PIDs:

Batch
==Code==

tasklist | findstr "<process_name>"

--
Replace <process_name> with the name of the process you want to find.

--------------------------------------------------------------
* How to Kill a Process?
--------------------------------------------------------------
To terminate or kill a process, you can use the kill command (or kill equivalent) on Linux/Unix systems. For example, to kill a process by its PID:

Bash
==Code==

kill <PID>

--
Replace <PID> with the actual PID of the process you want to terminate.

On Windows, you can use the taskkill command:

batch
==Code==

taskkill /PID <PID>
-----------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------
* What is a Signal?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A signal is a software interrupt delivered to a process to notify it of a specific event or request. Signals are used for inter-process communication and process management. They can be generated by the operating system, other processes, or the process itself.

--------------------------------------------------------------
* What are the Unignorable Signals
--------------------------------------------------------------
Two signals that cannot be ignored by a process are:

SIGKILL (9): This signal forcefully terminates a process without allowing it to perform any cleanup tasks. It's often used as a last resort to stop a misbehaving process.

Example 1: Using SIGKILL (9)
Scenario: You have a process with a PID of 12345 that has become unresponsive and needs to be forcefully terminated.

bash
==Code==

# Send the SIGKILL signal to process with PID 12345
kill -9 12345
--
In this example, the kill command is used with the -9 option to send the SIGKILL signal to the process with PID 12345. The process will be terminated immediately without any chance to perform cleanup actions.

--------------------------------------------------------------

SIGSTOP (19): This signal suspends a process, pausing its execution. Unlike other signals, a process cannot ignore or handle SIGSTOP. It can be resumed later using the SIGCONT signal.

Example 2: Using SIGSTOP (19) and SIGCONT (18)
Scenario: You want to temporarily pause a process with PID 6789 and then resume it later.

bash
==Code==

# Send the SIGSTOP signal to pause the process
kill -19 6789

# To resume the paused process, send the SIGCONT signal
kill -18 6789

--
In this example, the kill command is used with the -19 option to send the SIGSTOP signal to the process with PID 6789, which suspends its execution. Later, you can send the SIGCONT signal with -18 to resume the process.
