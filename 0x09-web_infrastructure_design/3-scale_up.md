In "3-scale_up.md," we're discussing the distinction between application servers and web servers in a scalable web infrastructure. Here's an overview of the content:

Title: Application Server vs. Web Server

Contents:

Introduction

Briefly introduce the topic of differentiating between web servers and application servers in a scalable web infrastructure.
Web Server

Explain the role of a web server in a web infrastructure.
Discuss why it's added to the architecture and how it handles web requests.
Highlight the need for web servers in serving static content efficiently.
Application Server

Explain the role of an application server and why it's included in the infrastructure.
Describe how it executes dynamic application code and processes complex business logic.
Emphasize that application servers are responsible for generating dynamic content.
Server Requirements

State the requirement to add one server to the infrastructure.
Mention the need for load balancing between servers for scalability and fault tolerance.
Explain that splitting components (web server, application server, and database) onto their own servers enhances flexibility.
HAproxy Load Balancer

Introduce the HAproxy load balancer and the concept of clustering.
Explain the purpose of load balancing in distributing traffic evenly across web and application servers.
Mention that clustering ensures high availability and better performance.
Conclusion

Summarize the importance of understanding the distinct roles of web and application servers in a scalable infrastructure.
Emphasize that splitting components and using load balancing are key strategies for scaling up web applications.
The document guides readers through the roles of web and application servers, the requirements for adding servers, and the benefits of load balancing in a scalable web infrastructure. It's designed to enhance the reader's understanding of these components and their significance in building robust web applications
