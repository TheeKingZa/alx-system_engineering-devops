# [How to] Install mysql 5.7

```
Copy the key here to your clipboard
```


[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/checking-gpg-signature.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/checking-gpg-signature.html)

```
    Save it in a file on your machine i.e. signature.key and then

        sudo apt-key add signature.key
```

add the apt repo

```
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu bionic mysql-5.7" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list'
    update apt

    sudo apt-get update

now check your available versions:

```
vagrant@ubuntu-focal:/vagrant$ sudo apt-cache policy mysql-server
mysql-server:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 8.0.27-0ubuntu0.20.04.1
  Version table:
     8.0.27-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 500
        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-updates/main amd64 Packages
        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security/main amd64 Packages
     8.0.19-0ubuntu5 500
        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal/main amd64 Packages
     5.7.37-1ubuntu18.04 500
        500 http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu bionic/mysql-5.7 amd64 Packages
```
Now install mysql 5.7
```
sudo apt install -f mysql-client=5.7* mysql-community-server=5.7* mysql-server=5.7*

# Main Role of a Database
```
A database is a structured collection of data that facilitates efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. It serves as a reliable and centralized system for managing information. The key roles of a database include:

- **Data Storage:** Storing data in an organized and structured manner.
- **Data Retrieval:** Efficiently retrieving specific data based on user queries.
- **Data Manipulation:** Updating, deleting, and inserting data as needed.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
```

# Database Replica
```
A database replica is a copy of the original database created and maintained to enhance system reliability and performance. Key characteristics of database replicas include:

- **Types of Replicas:** Primary (master) and secondary (slave) replicas.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing read operations across multiple replicas to improve performance.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Providing redundancy to ensure system availability in case of a primary replica failure.

```

# Purpose of a Database Replica

The primary purposes of having database replicas include:
```
- **High Availability:** Ensuring continuous access to data even in the face of hardware failures or maintenance.
- **Scalability:** Distributing read operations among replicas to handle increasing workloads.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Facilitating quick recovery in case of data center failures or disasters.
```

# Storing Backups in Different Physical Locations

Storing database backups in diverse physical locations is crucial for several reasons:
```
- **Disaster Recovery:** Protecting against data loss due to natural disasters, fires, or other catastrophic events.
- **Data Integrity:** Avoiding a single point of failure that could compromise all backups.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meeting regulatory requirements for data backup and storage.
```

# Regular Operations for Database Backup Strategy

To ensure the effectiveness of the database backup strategy, regularly perform the following operations:
```
- **Backup Testing:** Periodically restore backups to verify their completeness and integrity.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor backup processes to detect any issues or failures promptly.
- **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation on the backup strategy and recovery procedures.
```
