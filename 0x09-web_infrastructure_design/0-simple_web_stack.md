In "0-web_stack.md," we are designing a simple one-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com. Here's a summary of the document's content:

Title: Understanding a Basic Web Infrastructure

Contents:

Introduction

Introduce the concept of a simple web infrastructure powered by a single server.
User Accesses the Website

Describe how a user initiates access to the website by typing "www.foobar.com" in their browser.
Components of the Web Infrastructure

Explain the essential components used in the infrastructure:
1 Server
1 Nginx Web Server
1 Application Server
1 Application Code Base
1 MySQL Database
Domain Name "foobar.com" configured with a "www" record pointing to server IP 8.8.8.8.
Specifics Explained:

Define and explain the roles of key elements in the infrastructure:
What is a server?
The role of the domain name.
The type of DNS record "www" in "www.foobar.com."
The role of the web server.
The role of the application server.
The role of the database.
The communication method between the server and the user's computer.
Issues with the Infrastructure:

Highlight the potential issues with the designed infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF) due to the use of a single server.
Downtime during maintenance, especially when the web server needs to be restarted.
Inability to scale effectively if there's a surge in incoming traffic.
The document serves as an introductory guide to a basic web infrastructure, explaining its components, their roles, and the potential issues. It aims to provide a clear understanding of the fundamental aspects of web hosting and how they can be improved for reliability and scalability
