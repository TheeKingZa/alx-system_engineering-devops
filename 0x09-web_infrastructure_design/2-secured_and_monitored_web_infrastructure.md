In the "2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure," we've designed a secure and monitored web infrastructure for www.foobar.com with the following elements:

Firewalls protect the Load Balancer, Application Servers, and Database from unauthorized access and external threats.
SSL is used for encrypted traffic, ensuring secure communication between users and the website.
Monitoring tools collect data to monitor the infrastructure's health and performance.
Monitoring clients (e.g., Sumo Logic) are installed on servers to gather metrics and logs.
Specifics Explained:

Firewalls enhance security by protecting critical components.
SSL encryption secures data in transit.
Monitoring detects issues proactively through data collection.
Monitoring clients collect metrics and logs for analysis.
Issues with the Infrastructure:

Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer could expose unencrypted traffic within the internal network, so end-to-end encryption is preferable.
A single MySQL server for writes is a single point of failure; consider implementing replication or clustering for data redundancy.
Servers with identical components may not be optimized for scalability; customizing server configurations can be beneficial.
To enhance the infrastructure, address security and scalability concerns and ensure robust monitoring for reliable performance
