   Take note: The following instructions are run in a ubuntu-xenial virtual machine setup using Vagrant. To do the same, you can also install docker in any Vagrant virtual machine, or install docker on your host OS (Windows, Linux or Mac OS)

   Let’s first pull a Docker image and run a container:

	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker ps
	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             
 	CREATED             STATUS              PORTS
  	NAMES
	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker run -d -ti ubuntu:16.04
	Unable to find image 'ubuntu:16.04' locally
	16.04: Pulling from library/ubuntu
	34667c7e4631: Pull complete
	d18d76a881a4: Pull complete
	119c7358fbfc: Pull complete
	2aaf13f3eff0: Pull complete
	Digest: sha256:58d0da8bc2f434983c6ca4713b08be00ff5586eb5cdff47bcde4b2e88fd40f88
	Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:16.04
	e1fc0d4bbb5d3513b8f7666c91932812da7640346f6e05b7cfc3130ddbbb8278
	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker ps
	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             
 	CREATED              STATUS              PORTS
  	NAMES

 	About a minute ago   Up About a minute
  	keen_blackwell
	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$

  Note that docker command will pull the Ubuntu docker container image from the Internet and run it. I let you look at the meaning of the flags using the command docker run --help, the main idea is that it keeps the container up and running.

  [^](#docker)

  To execute a command on the Docker container, use docker exec:

	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker exec -i e1fc0d4bbb5d hostname
	e1fc0d4bbb5d
	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ hostname
	ubuntu-xenial
	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$

   If you want to connect to your Docker container and use Bash,
   you need to use docker exec -ti:
   
   	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker exec -ti e1fc0d4bbb5d /bin/bash
	root@e1fc0d4bbb5d:/# echo "I am in $(hostname) Docker container"
	I am in e1fc0d4bbb5d Docker container
	root@e1fc0d4bbb5d:/# exit
	exit
	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$

   If you want to stop a container, use docker stop:

	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker ps
	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             
 	CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               
  	NAMES
	e1fc0d4bbb5d        ubuntu:16.04        "/bin/bash"         
 	5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes                            
  	keen_blackwell
	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker stop e1fc0d4bbb5d
	e1fc0d4bbb5d
	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~$ docker ps
	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND

# Network Security Exploration
	This repository aims to provide an in-depth exploration of various network security concepts.
 	Below, we discuss key topics and provide guidance on understanding and experimenting with them.

[^](#need-to-know)

# Network Sniffing
	Network sniffing involves capturing and analyzing packets of data transmitted over a network.
 	While the provided code focuses on binary tree structures, a common tool for network sniffing is Wireshark. By running Wireshark on a network interface,
  	you can capture and inspect packets in real-time. For example:

		bashCode
			wireshark -i eth0
	This command launches Wireshark on the 'eth0' interface,
 	allowing you to analyze the network traffic.

[^](#need-to-know)

# ARP Spoofing
	Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing is a technique where an attacker sends false ARP messages to an Ethernet network.
 	Tools like arpspoof from the dsniff package can be used for this purpose. For example:

		bashCode
			arpspoof -i eth0 -t target_ip gateway_ip
	Replace eth0, target_ip, and gateway_ip with your specific
 	network interface and target details.

[^](#need-to-know)

# Connecting to SendGrid's SMTP Relay Using Telnet
	Telnet is a network protocol used to establish a connection to a remote server. To connect to SendGrid's SMTP relay using telnet, you can use:

		bashCode
			telnet smtp.sendgrid.net 587
	Replace smtp.sendgrid.net with the SMTP server address and 587 with the port.
	You can then interact with the SMTP server by typing SMTP commands.

[^](#need-to-know)

# Docker and Its Popularity
	Docker is a platform for developing,
 	shipping, and running applications in containers.
  	To run a simple Docker container, you can use:

		bashCode
			docker run -it --rm ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
	This command pulls the latest Ubuntu image,
 	runs an interactive shell,
  	and removes the container after exiting.
[^](#need-to-know)

# Dictionary Attack
	A dictionary attack involves systematically trying words from a precompiled list to gain unauthorized access. As an example, tools like hydra can be used for dictionary attacks on login systems. For SSH:

		bashCode
			hydra -l username -P /path/to/wordlist.txt 	ssh://target_ip

 	Replace username, /path/to/wordlist.txt, and target_ip with the appropriate values.

**Note**: The provided C code focuses on binary tree structures and is unrelated to the mentioned network security topics. It adheres to the Betty guidelines with comments explaining its functionality. Refer to the comments within the code for detailed explanations.

Remember to respect ethical guidelines and legal boundaries when exploring network security concepts.
