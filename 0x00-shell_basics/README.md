  * [LTS]()
  * [What does LTS mean?]()

# LTS (Long-Term Support):
    LTS, or Long-Term Support, designates software releases that prioritize stability over new features.
    These versions receive extended support, 
    making them suitable for enterprise use, 
    with collaboration among the development community to 
    ensure ongoing maintenance and security.

# Shebang:
    The shebang, represented by #! at the start of a script,
    specifies the interpreter to execute the script.
    It automates the interpreter selection, 
    allowing flexibility for various scripting languages 
    and the inclusion of environment variables. 
    The shebang is crucial for running scripts without 
    explicitly specifying the interpreter on the command line.
