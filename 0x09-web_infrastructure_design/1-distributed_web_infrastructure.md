In the "1-distributed_web_infrastructure," we've designed a web architecture for www.foobar.com with the following elements:

Load Balancer (HAproxy): Distributes web traffic evenly to two Application Servers for high availability and load balancing.

Application Servers (Server 1 and Server 2): Two servers handle website logic and assets, offering redundancy and scalability.

Web Server (Nginx): Manages incoming HTTP requests, forwarding dynamic content requests to the Application Servers.

Application Code Base: Contains the website's logic and assets, executing dynamic functionality.

Database (MySQL): Stores data such as user profiles and content, crucial for the website.

Specifics Explained:

Load Balancer uses a round-robin distribution algorithm for load balancing.

Active-Active setup means both Application Servers actively handle requests, enhancing reliability and scalability.

Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster ensures data redundancy and high availability.

The primary node handles write operations, while the replica serves as backup for read operations.

Issues:

Single Points of Failure (SPOF) include the Load Balancer, Web Server, and Database.

Security concerns due to the absence of a firewall and HTTPS.

Lack of monitoring tools to proactively manage the infrastructure.

To improve the infrastructure, address SPOFs with redundancy, enhance security with a firewall and HTTPS, and implement monitoring for proactive issue detection and resolution.
